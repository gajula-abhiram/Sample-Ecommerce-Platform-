This project is a complete e-commerce application featuring a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend. The frontend handles user interface elements like product display (categories, individual products, search results), user authentication (login, signup, profile), and shopping cart functionality, utilizing Redux for state management and Tailwind CSS for styling. The backend provides a REST API built with Express, managing data persistence through Mongoose connecting to a MongoDB database. It includes controllers for user sign-up, sign-in, user details management, product uploads, retrieval, updates, searching, filtering, and handling shopping cart operations. Authentication is handled using JWT stored in cookies.
